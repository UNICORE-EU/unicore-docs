"gateway.httpServer.enableHsts","[true, false]","false","Control whether HTTP strict transport security is enabled. It is a good and strongly suggested security mechanism for all production sites.

"gateway.httpServer.minThreads","integer >= 1","1","Minimum number of threads to have in the thread pool for processing HTTP connections.  Note that this number will be increased with few additional threads to handle connectors."

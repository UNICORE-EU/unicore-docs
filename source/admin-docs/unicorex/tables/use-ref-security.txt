Property name 	Type 	Default value / mandatory 	Description

container.security.accesscontrol[.*]
	

[true, false] can have subkeys
	

true
	

Controls whether access checking (authorisation) is enabled. Can be used per service after adding dot and service name to the property key. (runtime updateable)

container.security.accesscontrol.pdp
	

Class extending de.fzj.unicore.wsrflite.security.pdp.UnicoreXPDP
	

-
	

Controls which Policy Decision Point (PDP, the authorisation engine) should be used. Default value is determined as follows: if eu.unicore.uas.pdp.local.LocalHerasafPDP is available then it is used. If not then this option becomes mandatory.

container.security.accesscontrol.pdpConfig
	

filesystem path
	

-
	

Path of the PDP configuration file

container.security.additionalServiceIdentifier*
	

list of properties with a common prefix
	

-
	

List of additional service identifiers (e.g. URLs where this service is accessible) accepted in SAML authentication.

container.security.attributes[.*]
	

string can have subkeys
	

-
	

Prefix used for configurations of particular attribute sources.

container.security.attributes.combiningPolicy
	

string
	

MERGE_LAST_OVERRIDES
	

What algorithm should be used for combining the attributes from multiple attribute sources (if more then one is defined).

container.security.attributes.order
	

string
	

-
	

Attribute sources in invocation order.

container.security.credential.[.*]
	

string can have subkeys
	

-
	

Properties with this prefix are used to configure the credential used by the container. See separate documentation for details.

container.security.defaultVOs.<NUMBER>
	

list of properties with a common prefix
	

empty string
	

List of default VOs, which should be assigned for a request without a VO set. The first VO on the list where the user is member will be used.

container.security.delegationTruststore.[.*]
	

string can have subkeys
	

-
	

When separateDelegationTruststore is true allows to configure the trust delegation truststore (using normal truststore properties with this prefix).

container.security.dynamicAttributes[.*]
	

string can have subkeys
	

-
	

Prefix used for configurations of particular dynamic attribute sources.

container.security.dynamicAttributes.combiningPolicy
	

string
	

MERGE_LAST_OVERRIDES
	

What algorithm should be used for combining the attributes from multiple dynamic attribute sources (if more then one is defined).

container.security.dynamicAttributes.order
	

string
	

-
	

Dynamic attribute sources in invocation order.

container.security.gateway.certificate
	

filesystem path
	

-
	

Path to gateway's certificate file in PEM or DER format. Note that DER format is used only for files with .der extension. It is used only for gateway's authentication assertions verification (if enabled). Note that this is not needed to set it if waiting for gateway on startup is turned on.

container.security.gateway.checkSignature
	

[true, false]
	

true
	

Controls whether gateway's authentication assertions are verified.

container.security.gateway.enable
	

[true, false]
	

true
	

Whether to accept gateway-based authentication. Note that if it is enabled either the site must be secured (usually via firewall) to disable non-gateway access or the verification of gateway's assertions must be enabled.

container.security.gateway.registration
	

[true, false]
	

false
	

Whether the site should try to autoregister itself with the Gateway. This must be also configured on the Gateway side.

container.security.gateway.registrationSecret
	

string
	

-
	

Required secret when autoregistering with the Gateway. This must match the secret configured on the Gateway side.

container.security.gateway.registrationUpdateInterval
	

integer >= 10
	

30
	

How often the automatic gateway registration should be refreshed.

container.security.gateway.waitOnStartup
	

[true, false]
	

true
	

Controls whether to wait for the gateway at startup.

container.security.gateway.waitTime
	

integer >= 1
	

180
	

Controls for how long to wait for the gateway on startup (in seconds).

container.security.rest[.*]
	

string can have subkeys
	

-
	

Prefix used to configure REST subsystem security. See separate docs.

container.security.separateDelegationTruststore
	

[true, false]
	

false
	

Significant for XSEDE integration: when turned on, allows for using a separate truststore for delegation checking then the one used for SSL connections checking.

container.security.sessionLifetime
	

integer >= 1
	

28800
	

Controls the lifetime of security sessions (in seconds).

container.security.sessionsEnabled
	

[true, false]
	

true
	

Controls whether the server supports security sessions which reduce client/server traffic and load.

container.security.sessionsPerUser
	

integer >= 1
	

5
	

Controls the number of security sessions each user can have. If exceeded, some cleanup will be performed.

container.security.signatures
	

[true, false]
	

false
	

Controls whether signatures (providing non-repudiation guarantees) on key requests should be required. If the system is setup without user certificates, signatures must be disabled.

container.security.sslEnabled
	

[true, false]
	

true
	

Controls whether secure SSL mode is enabled.

container.security.trustedAssertionIssuers.[.*]
	

string can have subkeys
	

-
	

Allows for configuring a truststore (using normal truststore properties with this prefix) with certificates of trusted services (not CAs!) which are permitted to issue trust delegations and authenticate with SAML. Typically this truststore should contain certificates of all Unity instanes installed.

container.security.truststore.[.*]
	

string can have subkeys
	

-
	

Properties with this prefix are used to configure container's trust settings and certificates validation. See separate documentation for details.

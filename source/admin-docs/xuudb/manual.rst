XUUDB Manual
============

The XUUDB server is an Attribute Source implementation which can be used by 
UNICORE servers. It is used to map a UNICORE identity (an X500 distinguished name) 
to authorisation and incarnation attributes. The XUUDB is also capable of performing 
dynamic mappings of incarnation attributes, using a rule engine.

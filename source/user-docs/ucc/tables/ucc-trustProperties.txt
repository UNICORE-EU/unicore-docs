Property name	Type	Default value / mandatory	Description

truststore.allowProxy

[ALLOW, DENY]

ALLOW

Controls whether proxy certificates are supported.

truststore.type

[keystore, openssl, directory]

mandatory to be set

The truststore type.

truststore.updateInterval

integer number

600

How often the truststore should be reloaded, in seconds. Set to negative value to disable refreshing at runtime. (runtime updateable)

truststore.directoryConnectionTimeout

integer number

15

Connection timeout for fetching the remote CA certificates in seconds.

truststore.directoryDiskCachePath

filesystem path

-

Directory where CA certificates should be cached, after downloading them from a remote source. Can be left undefined if no disk cache should be used. Note that directory should be secured, i.e. normal users should not be allowed to write to it.

truststore.directoryEncoding

[PEM, DER]

PEM

For directory truststore controls whether certificates are encoded in PEM or DER. Note that the PEM file can contain arbitrary number of concatenated, PEM-encoded certificates.

truststore.directoryLocations.*

list of properties with a common prefix

-

List of CA certificates locations. Can contain URLs, local files and wildcard expressions. (runtime updateable)

truststore.keystoreFormat

string

-

The keystore type (jks, pkcs12) in case of truststore of keystore type.

truststore.keystorePassword

string

-

The password of the keystore type truststore.

truststore.keystorePath

string

-

The keystore path in case of truststore of keystore type.


truststore.opensslNewStoreFormat

[true, false]

false

In case of openssl truststore, specifies whether the trust store is in openssl 1.0.0+ format (true) or older openssl 0.x format (false)

truststore.opensslNsMode

[GLOBUS_EUGRIDPMA, EUGRIDPMA_GLOBUS, GLOBUS, EUGRIDPMA, GLOBUS_EUGRIDPMA_REQUIRE, EUGRIDPMA_GLOBUS_REQUIRE, GLOBUS_REQUIRE, EUGRIDPMA_REQUIRE, EUGRIDPMA_AND_GLOBUS, EUGRIDPMA_AND_GLOBUS_REQUIRE, IGNORE]

EUGRIDPMA_GLOBUS

In case of openssl truststore, controls which (and in which order) namespace checking rules should be applied. The REQUIRE settings will cause that all configured namespace definitions files must be present for each trusted CA certificate (otherwise checking will fail). The AND settings will cause to check both existing namespace files. Otherwise the first found is checked (in the order defined by the property).

truststore.opensslPath

filesystem path

/etc/grid-security/certificates

Directory to be used for opeenssl truststore.


truststore.crlConnectionTimeout

integer number

15

Connection timeout for fetching the remote CRLs in seconds (not used for Openssl truststores).

truststore.crlDiskCachePath

filesystem path

-

Directory where CRLs should be cached, after downloading them from remote source. Can be left undefined if no disk cache should be used. Note that directory should be secured, i.e. normal users should not be allowed to write to it. Not used for Openssl truststores.

truststore.crlLocations.*

list of properties with a common prefix

-

List of CRLs locations. Can contain URLs, local files and wildcard expressions. Not used for Openssl truststores. (runtime updateable)

truststore.crlMode

[REQUIRE, IF_VALID, IGNORE]

IF_VALID

General CRL handling mode. The IF_VALID setting turns on CRL checking only in case the CRL is present.

truststore.crlUpdateInterval

integer number

600

How often CRLs should be updated, in seconds. Set to negative value to disable refreshing at runtime. (runtime updateable)

truststore.ocspCacheTtl

integer number

3600

For how long the OCSP responses should be locally cached in seconds (this is a maximum value, responses won't be cached after expiration)

truststore.ocspDiskCache

filesystem path

-

If this property is defined then OCSP responses will be cached on disk in the defined folder.

truststore.ocspLocalResponders.<NUMBER>

list of properties with a common prefix

-

Optional list of local OCSP responders

truststore.ocspMode

[REQUIRE, IF_AVAILABLE, IGNORE]

IF_AVAILABLE

General OCSP ckecking mode. REQUIRE should not be used unless it is guaranteed that for all certificates an OCSP responder is defined.

truststore.ocspTimeout

integer number

10000

Timeout for OCSP connections in miliseconds.

truststore.revocationOrder

[CRL_OCSP, OCSP_CRL]

OCSP_CRL

Controls overal revocation sources order

truststore.revocationUseAll

[true, false]

false

Controls whether all defined revocation sources should be always checked, even if the first one already confirmed that a checked certificate is not revoked.

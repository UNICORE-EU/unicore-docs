GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD

CORS: comma separated list of allowed HTTP verbs.

xuudb.httpServer.CORS_allowedOrigins

string

CORS: allowed script origins.

xuudb.httpServer.CORS_chainPreflight

xuudb.httpServer.enableCORS

[true, false]

Control whether Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is enabled. Enable to allow e.g. accesing REST services from client-side JavaScript.

xuudb.httpServer.enableHsts

[true, false]

false

Control whether HTTP strict transport security is enabled. It is a good and strongly suggested security mechanism for all production sites. At the same time it can not be used with self-signed or not issued by a generally trusted CA server certificates, as with HSTS a user can't opt in to enter such site.

xuudb.httpServer.fastRandom

[true, false]

false

Use insecure, but fast pseudo random generator to generate session ids instead of secure generator for SSL sockets.

xuudb.httpServer.gzip.enable

[true, false]

false

Controls whether to enable compression of HTTP responses.

xuudb.httpServer.gzip.minGzipSize

integer number

100000

Specifies the minimal size of message that should be compressed.

xuudb.httpServer.highLoadConnections

integer number

200

deprecated

xuudb.httpServer.lowResourceMaxIdleTime

integer >= 1

100

deprecated

xuudb.httpServer.maxConnections

integer >= 0

0

Maximum number of incoming connections to this server. If set to a value larger than 0, incoming connections will be limited to that number. Default is 0 = unlimited.

xuudb.httpServer.maxIdleTime

integer >= 1

200000

Time (in ms.) before an idle connection will time out. It should be large enough not to expire connections with slow clients, values below 30s are getting quite risky.

xuudb.httpServer.maxThreads

integer number

255

Maximum number of threads to have in the thread pool for processing HTTP connections. Note that this number will be increased with few additional threads to handle connectors.

xuudb.httpServer.minThreads

integer >= 1

1

Minimum number of threads to have in the thread pool for processing HTTP connections. Note that this number will be increased with few additional threads to handle connectors.

xuudb.httpServer.requireClientAuthn

[true, false]

true

Controls whether the SSL socket requires client-side authentication.

xuudb.httpServer.wantClientAuthn

[true, false]

true

Controls whether the SSL socket accepts (but does not require) client-side authentication.

xuudb.httpServer.xFrameAllowed

string

\http://localhost

URI origin that is allowed to embed web interface inside a (i)frame. Meaningful only if the xFrameOptions is set to allowFrom. The value should be in the form: \http[s]://host[:port]

xuudb.httpServer.xFrameOptions

[deny, sameOrigin, allowFrom, allow]

deny

Defines whether a clickjacking prevention should be turned on, by insertionof the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. The allow value disables the feature. See the RFC 7034 for details. Note that for the allowFrom you should define also the xFrameAllowed option and it is not fully supported by all the browsers.
